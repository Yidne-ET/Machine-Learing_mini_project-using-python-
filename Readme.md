This project involves using machine learning to boost sales for an online music store. When users sign up, we ask for their age and gender, then recommend music albums theyâ€™re likely to buy based on their profiles. The aim is to leverage machine learning to enhance sales.

To achieve this, I built a model and fed it sample data from existing users. The model learned patterns in our data, enabling us to make predictions. When a new user signs up, we can input their profile into the model and receive music recommendations, such as jazz or hip hop, tailored to their preferences. This effectively solves the problem of personalized music suggestions.

Here are the steps I followed:

Imported data from a music.csvfile with columns for age, gender, and genre (the data is fictitious for this project).

Cleaned the data.

Selected a machine learning algorithm to build the model.

Trained the model and generated predictions.

Evaluated the model's accuracy.
